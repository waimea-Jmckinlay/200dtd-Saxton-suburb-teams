# Relevant Implications

## Functionality Implications

This means that the website works well with little to no errors 
when there shouldn't be any 

### Relevance to the System
this is relevance to the system because if the website doesn't work 
then what was the point of making it in the first place 

### Impact / Considerations
I will need to insure that the website is working the way it should by 
error testing everything and fixing any errors that show them selfs 



## Usability Implications
This implication means to make the website quick and easy to use 
for the end-user   

### Relevance to the System

This is relevant to the system because the whole point of my 
website, to make things quick and easy for the end users to 
use for the users to gain the information they need for the 
next game and make it easy for the saxtons club to give the
 information to parents and coaches about the upcoming games. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will design the website to be easy to use by using color palets that
help the end users under stand whats going on  



## End-User Implications

This means the specific needs of my end user need to be met.
the needs very depending on my end users

### Relevance to the System
This implication is relevant to the system because I need to meet the 
needs of my end users me end users being either parents of the kids 
playing or the club to update the website and import the information 
into the website and to be useable on phone 

### Impact / Considerations
I will need to consider the age of the user if the end user is able to find 
the information they are looking for or able to update the website, and use languages 
suitable for the end users 



##  Accessibility Implications:
this means the end user is able to access the information they are looking for
or curtain users can use a key to edit the website to add and update information

### Relevance to the System
This is relevant to the system because my system requires the ability where 
only curtain people can access the page to update it while the rest can only
look at the information 

### Impact / Considerations
This will have an Impact as I will have to make a key 
to let curtain end users change and edit the website 
while not letting others do so as wall as making my website 
work on phone and computer and I would have to consider what if 
my end user haves a disability towards reading and i will have to find away around it 



## Aesthetic Implications
This implication means my website has to 
 appeal to the end-users and not contain any 
 copyright logos 

### Relevance to the System
This is relevant to my website because I wouldn't want 
to offend anyone one with bad color choice and I would want 
to use relevant colors so the user doesn't fell that they are on the 
wrong website as the football club dose have their own colors

### Impact / Considerations

This will Impact my website as a hole as I will have to be considering 
this every-time I go to pick a color od make a design choice
