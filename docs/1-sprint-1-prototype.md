# Sprint 1 - A Working UI Prototype


## Sprint Goals

Develop a prototype that simulates the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the model for the next phase of development in Sprint 2.

[Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is used to develop the prototype.

## Initial Database Design

This is the initial design for the database linking players to teams 
and games to teams games have the data for when and where the game is and what teams will be playing there the players table holds the players names and the 
teams table stores the team name and details about the team

## Database Design
I have desided that 2 database would work better

## UI 'Flow'

The first stage of prototyping was to explore how the UI might 'flow' between states, based on the required functionality.

This Figma demo shows the initial design for the UI 'flow':

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="500" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/lEVdKTzeh7p7tJCxz3VMmh/Untitled?node-id=1-30&p=f&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A30&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

while testing my end user pointed out if there are lots of teams 
which there will be that it may get harder for them to find the team they are looking for and I fugered the same would happen with the admin panal when wanting t edit the teams infomation also they didn't like the though of someone else knowing where they kid is going be though out the day the end user found on the page where we add a team that im using space the doesn't need to be used and i also came to a relize saion that my website would be best on phone and would requre a good font size 
to read off of a phone 

### Changes / Improvements
I redesign the first page so there was a sech bar with a drop down menu and same for the admin panal and I found a way to free up some more space on the edit or add team page and I removed the ablity for people to see which team the kids are in unlest their an admin by having it only show on a page that only they can get to.

## Initial UI Prototype

The next stage of prototyping was to develop the layout for each screen of the UI.

This Figma demo shows the initial layout design for the UI:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="500" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/49a3NlBuCJ3h9JossPFUm8/Untitled?scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-9&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

As testing I keeped changing things make the ui flow better for what I wanted I mostly just 
change the size and placement of things till it worked

### Changes / Improvements

the ui was kind of ugly and was just made out of a bunch a low quaty boxes and text so I made it look better and made it so it works on phone as well 

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="500" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/Z8Q5cm8K8hLonovTUr1R7b/Untitled?node-id=1-71&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Refined UI Prototype

Having established the layout of the UI screens, the prototype was refined visually, in terms of color, fonts, etc.

This Figma demo shows the UI with refinements applied:

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/9TtjVESK3EH00N4nyNlE7y/Untitled--Copy---Copy-?node-id=1-9&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Testing

I keeped fliping thoughout the pages makeing changes to colur and front untill i was happy with it

### Changes / Improvements

because the webpage was mostly a darker colur I found that some of my text had to be white so the uesr could read it 

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="500" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/WFCK1XubxPxWe4KIDEi7FY/Untitled--Copy-?node-id=1-2&p=f&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=1%3A2&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Sprint Review

we have a good blue print for the websight which will help us make the websight.
